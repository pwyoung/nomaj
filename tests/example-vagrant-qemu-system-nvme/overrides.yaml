# NOTE
#   If you place a file overrides.yaml in the directory with config.yaml
#   then the files will be merged to produce ./build/config.yaml which
#   is used subsequently.
#   This file shows some examples of things you might want to override.

#    # This can be used on Linux to force Vagrant to use Virtualbox
#    force_provider: "virtualbox"
#
#    # Omit any boxes beyond 'limit_num_boxes' from the Vagrantfile
#    limit_boxes: "yes"
#    limit_num_boxes: 2
#
#    # If not "true" then omit from Vagrantfile
#    virtualbox_cfg:
#      enabled: "false"
#    libvirt_cfg:

#
# # There is some support for static IPs.
# #  - On VirtualBox:
# #    - 'ip', if given,  will be the ip of a Nic on an internal network
# #    - 'ip2', if given, will be the ip of (an additional) Nic on an internal network
# #    - 'netmask', if given, will be applied to the above networks.
# #  - On Libvirt, the values of 'ip', 'ip2', and 'netmask' (currently) don't currently matter.
# #    - 'ip2', if given, cause a second NIC to be created (on 'libvir1')
# #    - In future, we could automate management of QEMU networks (as we do with QEMU disks)
# # Example
#  boxes:
#    - name: node-3
#      ip: 192.254.3.10
#      netmask: 255.255.255.128
#      ip2: 192.254.3.138
