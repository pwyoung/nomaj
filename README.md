# DESCRIPTION
There's no magic here.

# GOAL
The goal of this project is to allow a user to manage an entire project with:
- a single config file
- a single override file (e.g. to force local environment settings)
- a simple, flexible, intuitive way to process the config file

# DOCS
-  See ./docs/algorithm.md for details of how the program works
-  See ./tests/* for example usage
